## Gregory M. Kapfhammer

## Re-type the sentence "I adhered to the Allegheny College Honor Code while completing this project."

TODO: You must retype the sentence here in order to digitally sign your pledge.

**IMPORTANT:** If you do not type the required sentence then the course
instructor will not know that you adhered to the Allegheny College Honor Code
while completing the project.

## Program Output

### Report at least two examples of program output from when you run the `cryptobenchmark` program

TODO: Make sure that the output is formatted as a fenced code block
TODO: Make sure that the output illustrates different configurations of the program

#### First output from running the `cryptobenchmark` program

#### Second output from running the `cryptobenchmark` program

## Performance Analysis

### Using data you collected and then furnished in a fenced code block, which is faster `Fernet` or `rFernet`?

TODO: Use a fenced code block to provide the requested output from running your benchmarks
TODO: Write at least one paragraph to explain which algorithm is faster,
explaining why this is the case whenever it is possible to do so

### Explain in detail the source code that you implemented to produce the formatted table of results

TODO: Use a fenced code block to provide the source code that you used to produce the formatted table of results
TODO: Make sure that you explain each code step and how it achieves the formatting

### Explain in detail the source code that you implemented to randomly generate the characters

TODO: Use a fenced code block to provide the source code that you used to produce the randomly generate characters
TODO: Make sure that you explain each code step and how it generates the data used in a benchmark

### Explain in detail the source code that you implemented to collect time and memory overhead data

TODO: Use a fenced code block to provide the source code that you used to collect time and memory overhead data
TODO: Make sure that you explain each code step and how it collects the performance data

## Professional Development

### What is challenging about designing and using an automated doubling experiment for cryptography algorithms?

TODO: Provide a one-paragraph response that answers this question in your own words.
TODO: Make sure that your response specifically incorporates an aspect of this
project that is clearly evident in your source code and/or program output.
TODO: Make sure that your response provides low-level details and avoids high-level generalities.

### How do your experiences with this project suggest that you don't know the whole story about the performance of cryptographic algorithms?

TODO: Provide a one-paragraph response that answers this question in your own words.
TODO: Make sure that your response specifically incorporates an aspect of this
project that is clearly evident in your source code and/or program output.
TODO: Make sure that your response provides low-level details and avoids high-level generalities.

### Take Home Points

TODO: Provide a two to three sentence statement about the key takeaways from
conducting this experiment. Please note that the course instructor will display
some student takeaways on the course web site and use them to facilitate
follow-on class discussions.
